# X-Team 84 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
Mutually divide initial tasks, and reassign as needed over communication channels.



## How we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
We will update a TODO file on github to track our progress, as well as referring to internal TODO items in Java.



## How we will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
We will maintain communication over Groupme and text.



## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
We will track progress through github and gently remind each other of upcoming deadlines and provide any necessary support. We will also assign one team member to complete the final submission.



## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
Communication is key!
Check in with each other during active projects.
